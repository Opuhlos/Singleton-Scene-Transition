# Singleton Scene Transition
My attempt at creating a scene transition that connects two "rooms". This also features some crude menus.

I used [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIrQ1PsEl3s) to figure out how to connect signals via code between a scene and autoload singleton since I was having trouble figuring it out.

## What I learnt
- more about autolaod singletons
- more about connecting signals through code

# Somethings I'm proud of
- the scene transition animations
    - not the animation itself but the logic behind it/how I implemented it
